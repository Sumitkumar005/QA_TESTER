## Scalability and Data Handling

- **Handles Large Codebases:** Capable of analyzing repositories with hundreds to thousands of files and millions of lines of code.
- **Efficient Vector Database:** Uses FAISS-based vector search engine for fast similarity search and retrieval of relevant code snippets and issues.
- **MongoDB Backend:** Stores analysis reports, metrics, and metadata in a scalable NoSQL database.
- **Supports Archives and Single Files:** Can analyze uploaded archives (.zip, .tar.gz) or individual source code files.
- **GitHub Integration:** Clones and analyzes public and private GitHub repositories using authentication tokens.

## Core Features

### 1. Comprehensive Code Analysis

- **Multi-language Support:** Analyzes a wide range of programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, C/C++, Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, Scala, Swift, SQL, Shell scripts, and more.
- **Static Code Quality Checks:** Detects code smells, complexity, duplication, and maintainability issues.
- **Security Vulnerability Detection:** Identifies potential security risks such as injection flaws, memory leaks, and unsafe coding patterns.
- **Performance Bottleneck Identification:** Highlights slow or inefficient code sections.
- **Test Coverage Insights:** Provides recommendations on improving test coverage and reliability.
- **Severity Scoring:** Automatically scores issues by severity and impact using a custom severity scorer.

### 2. AI-Powered Q&A System

- **Interactive Question Answering:** Ask natural language questions about your codebase and analysis reports.
- **Context-Aware Responses:** Answers are generated using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combining AI models with indexed code context.
- **Confidence Scoring:** Provides confidence levels for answers and references source documents.
- **Fallback Keyword Responses:** Offers helpful fallback answers when AI is unavailable.

### 3. Rich CLI Interface

- **User-Friendly CLI:** Built with Click and Rich libraries for beautiful, interactive command-line experience.
- **Multiple Output Formats:** Supports JSON, table, and summary output formats.
- **Asynchronous Analysis:** Run analyses asynchronously with progress tracking and status commands.
- **Health Checks:** Verify system components and API connectivity.

### 4. Web Frontend

- **React-Based UI:** Modern frontend with pages for analysis, reports, Q&A, and progress tracking.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Displays live analysis progress and results.
- **Detailed Reports:** View issue lists, file metrics, and quality scores.
- **Interactive Q&A Interface:** Chat-like interface for asking questions about code quality.

### 5. Extensibility and Integration

- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend analysis rules, add new languages, or integrate additional AI models.
- **API-First Design:** Full REST API for integration with CI/CD pipelines, IDEs, and other tools.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Supports containerized deployment for easy scaling and cloud hosting.
- **Makefile and Scripts:** Provides setup, testing, and deployment automation scripts.

## Minor and Supporting Features

- **Archive Extraction:** Automatically extracts uploaded archives for analysis.
- **Temporary File Cleanup:** Cleans up temporary files after analysis.
- **Severity Prioritization:** Sorts issues by priority for focused remediation.
- **Configurable Exclusions:** Exclude files or directories from analysis.
- **Test Inclusion Toggle:** Optionally include or exclude test files.
- **Detailed Logging:** Logs analysis progress and errors for troubleshooting.
- **Health Endpoint:** API endpoint to check system health and dependencies.
- **GitHub Token Support:** Uses GitHub tokens for authenticated repository access.
- **Gemini AI Integration:** Uses Google Gemini API for advanced AI capabilities (if configured).
- **Fallback AI Responses:** Provides keyword-based answers if AI is not configured.
- **Rich Text Formatting:** Uses Rich library for colored and formatted CLI output.
- **Progress Bars and Spinners:** Visual feedback during long-running tasks.
- **Quality Score Calculation:** Calculates overall and category-specific quality scores.
- **Issue Trend Tracking:** Tracks issue trends over time for continuous improvement.
