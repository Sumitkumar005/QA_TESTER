# Code Quality Intelligence Agent - Testing Plan and Features Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing plan for the entire Code Quality Intelligence Agent project, along with a detailed list of all features to be tested. This will serve as a guide for in-depth testing and demo preparation.

## Features to be Tested

### 1. Code Analysis Features
- Multi-language static code analysis (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, C/C++, Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, Scala, Swift, SQL, Shell scripts, etc.)
- Security vulnerability detection
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Code quality and maintainability checks
- Test coverage analysis and recommendations
- Severity scoring and issue prioritization
- Support for single files, archives, and GitHub repositories

### 2. CLI Interface
- Command group and subcommands (`analyze`, `qa`, `status`, `health`, etc.)
- Options for languages, exclude patterns, output formats, and test inclusion
- Asynchronous analysis with progress tracking
- Output formats: JSON, table, summary
- Error handling and logging

### 3. Web Frontend
- React-based UI components and pages
- Analysis progress and results display
- Interactive Q&A chat interface
- Reports and issue lists with filtering and sorting
- File metrics and quality score visualization
- Navigation and user experience

### 4. API Endpoints
- `/api/v1/analyze` - Start analysis
- `/api/v1/status/{report_id}` - Check analysis status
- `/api/v1/report/{report_id}` - Fetch detailed report
- `/api/v1/qa/ask` - Ask questions about analysis
- `/api/v1/health` - System health check
- Other API routes for reports, PR reviews, etc.

### 5. Backend Services
- Analysis service orchestration
- GitHub repository cloning and authentication
- Vector database indexing and search (FAISS)
- MongoDB data storage and retrieval
- AI-powered Q&A service with Gemini integration and fallback
- Archive extraction and temporary file cleanup

### 6. Infrastructure and Deployment
- Docker and Docker Compose configurations
- Setup scripts for backend and frontend
- Makefile commands for installation, testing, linting, formatting, and deployment
- Health checks and monitoring

## Testing Plan

### Critical-Path Testing (Minimum)
- Run analysis on sample local directory and GitHub repo
- Verify CLI commands and options work as expected
- Test Q&A functionality with sample questions
- Check API endpoints for correct responses and error handling
- Validate frontend displays analysis results and Q&A interface
- Confirm database entries and vector indexing occur correctly

### Thorough Testing (Complete Coverage)
- Test all supported languages and file types
- Exercise all CLI commands with various option combinations
- Perform edge case testing for uploads, archives, and invalid inputs
- Test API endpoints with valid and invalid data, including security tests
- Navigate all frontend pages, interact with all UI elements
- Test backend services for concurrency, cancellation, and error recovery
- Validate deployment scripts and Docker containers in different environments

## Next Steps

- Please confirm if you want me to proceed with thorough testing as outlined.
- I will prepare detailed test cases and execute them step-by-step.
- I can also assist in creating demo scripts for your video presentation.

This plan ensures the entire project is robust, reliable, and ready for production use.
